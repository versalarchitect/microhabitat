Since 2021, over 2,850 pounds of vegetables, edible flowers and herbs have been harvested and donated to local food banks. Working with MicroHabitat is a rewarding experience, as their expertise and passion for urban agriculture enable us to create collaborative initiatives that transform our workspaces into true oases of greenery and sustainability.",

Our rooftop garden has brought new life to our property and re-ignited our tenant engagement initiatives following the Pandemic. It is fulfilling to know our annual harvests support local food banks within our community and we could not be more grateful to the MicroHabitat team in facilitating this reality. I am excited for what the future holds in our journey together.",
