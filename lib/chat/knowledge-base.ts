SECTION 5: THE MICROHABITAT POT
================================================================================

PRODUCT OVERVIEW:
The MicroHabitat geotextile pot is our signature growing container, different from SmartPots.

MATERIAL:
- Made from polyester (BPA-free plastic base textile)
- Manufactured in China (continuous process to find local production)

KEY BENEFITS:
- Allows airflow to roots for optimal growth
- Provides excellent soil drainage
- Overwinters - no need to remove soil during winter (unlike plastic or terracotta)
- Creates soil depth for cultivating a wide variety of vegetables
- Enables denser cultivation due to breathability
- Example: In a 5-gallon pot, you can plant 1 pepper plant + 10 onions

SIZES AVAILABLE:
- 5-gallon: Used for pot and seed kits, corporate gifts, available for purchase
- 20-gallon: Currently used in all gardens
- 30-gallon: Previously used

LIFESPAN:
5 to 10 years depending on usage. Best practices:
- Avoid moving pots when possible
- Never move using handles when filled with soil (handles will break)
- Move by lifting from underneath

HOW TO USE:
1. Open package and remove geotextile pot
2. Find area with at least 6 hours of direct sunlight
3. Use plant saucer on patio/balcony to keep area clean
4. On ground, place directly on grass or cement
5. Fill with soil mix
6. Thoroughly soak soil (may need to refill after first soaking)
7. Sow seeds according to packet instructions
8. Lightly water and enjoy!

POT REPAIR:
If holes appear from pests or damage, cut a piece from another pot, cover the hole from inside, and staple the patch in place.

PROTECTIVE MEMBRANE:
Used on rooftops, terraces, or wooden surfaces between the surface and the pot to:
- Protect the surface under the pot
- Facilitate moving/sliding the pots
- Enable easier end-of-season cleanup

SOCIAL IMPACT:
For every MicroHabitat pot sold, we finance two breakfasts for the Breakfast Club of Canada to fight food insecurity amongst children. In 2020, MicroHabitat financed more than 5,000 breakfasts.

WHY ECOLOGICAL URBAN FARMING?
- 60% of human population expected to live in cities by 2050
- Urbanization puts unprecedented stress on procurement chains
- World has lost 1/3 of arable land in past 40 years due to erosion/pollution
- Canada's climate warming twice as fast as global average
- Need to develop resilient food systems

CITIES: THE PERFECT PLACE TO GROW FOOD
- More nature for urban dwellers
- Easy access to water, energy, and flat surfaces
- Prevalence of unused spaces (rooftops, parking lots)
- Very limited pesticide contamination
- Heat island effect makes growing easier
- Higher CO2 in atmosphere promotes plant growth
- Increased labor force compared to rural zones

ECOLOGICAL VS CONVENTIONAL AGRICULTURE:
Ecological:
- Location: Rural and Urban
- Objective: Sustainability
- Yields: High
- Water Retention: High-Moderate
- Biodiversity: High
- Soil Quality: Rich
- Chemical pesticides: Forbidden
- Maintenance: Relatively complex

Conventional:
- Location: Rural only
- Objective: High yields
- Water Retention: Low
